<H1>About Andy</H1>
<p>I am a committed life learner and servant leader, willing to embrace and exceed the expectations of all challenges presented to me. I am an innovative, motivated critical thinker, receiving and providing all ideas and communication in an open minded and adaptive manner. I am collaborative, friendly, dependable, and compassionate in all of my dealings. My true desire is to work for a company that allows me to be creative, innovative, and encourage my passionate need for knowledge. I also must work for a company that fosters an environment that allows me to contribute to something bigger than myself. 

Quotations I live by:

“I have no special Talent, only that I am passionately curious”
					--Albert Einstein

“Character is defined by how you treat those who can do nothing for you.”
					--Anonymous
